# Java-practice

Practice exercises from the University of Helsinkiâ€™s Java course. Link: https://java-programming.mooc.fi/

The IDE I use for this course is NetBeans.

All of these exercises were checked and approved by the automatic testing service provided in the course (TMC - TestMyCode).

The folders in this repo are divided according to the structure followed by the course. Also, each folder is divided in subparts.
For the code go to src/main/java inside each exercise folder and open the Java file.

I haven't finished this course yet. I'll upload more exercises as I do them.
